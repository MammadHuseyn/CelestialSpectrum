                        <h2>The Hour of Code</h2>
                        <p>The Hour of Code is an annual event usually held in the month of December, 
                                            which aims at introducing kids to the basics of coding and computer science. 
                                            We organized our Hour of Code event a month early in November with the aim
                                            of instigating interest in programming and emphasizing its importance towards the future.</p>

                        <h3>Preparation</h3>
                            <p>We met at noon and coordinated with the assistant director to confirm the 
                            classroom and students. First assigned a room with a VGA projector, 
                            we asked for the computer lab due to incompatibility problems. There, 
                            we set up a presentation and arranged computers with Azerbaijani-language
                            puzzles using the laptops of the school to get over technical problems.</p>

                        <h3>Event</h3>
                        <p>At 1:00 PM, 21 seventh-grade students arrived. Huseyn introduced our team, 
                            our purpose, and informed about ADA University. Cavid showed the first
                            two puzzles and led the students to the sixth puzzle with emphasis on 
                            fundamental problem-solving skills. Students worked individually or 
                            in small groups, with team members assisting as needed. Emil later explained loops, 
                            demonstrating their use to simplify code blocks. After reaching the tenth puzzle,
                            Nazrin introduced conditional statements with relatable examples, guiding students 
                            through additional tasks. Although there were some problems, the 
                            "Classic Maze" puzzles were completed by all within 40 minutes. 
                            The students were awarded certificates with photos of the groups and 
                            also individually, although a few of them refused pictures.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>The event was a success; it gave students a basis in coding and
                            introduced them to ADA University. That alone proved their 
                            engagement and interest in programming; it was quite rewarding for them and our team.</p>
